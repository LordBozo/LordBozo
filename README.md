I’m interested in game development and novel math
I’m currently learning Comp Sci, focused on game dev 
If for some reason you need to contact me, most direct is through discord: Lol Bozo#3738, or email: Ysquared.Lolbozo@gmail.com
Feel free to reach out if you need help in making a game, I mostly specialize in turn based games, physics based movement, and higher dimensional games, but always willing to learn new things
A lot of my projects are not open source, but if you have questions about how part of a project was made, I'd be happy to explain any of my systems
